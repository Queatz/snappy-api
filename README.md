# Village - Public API

## Introduction

Village provides a public API.  You can use this to embed real-time, relevant information into your website.
For example, if you host an acting workshop, it may be useful to your visitors to contain a real-time list of nearby actors embedded in your site.

You need a Village account to use the API, and then can use the auth token generated to make additional requests.

All dates are described as strings and in the following format: `"June 30, 2009 7:03:47 AM PDT"`

## Endpoint and Authentication

The most basic call is getting information about yourself:

`http://queatz-snappy.appspot.com/api/me?auth=token`

```json
{
    "firstName": "Tara",
    "lastName": "Planas",
    "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g1XcJERenNY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/Qz35FKz9CSk/photo.jpg?sz=50",
    "auth": "286ba50c-f0bd-43d0-8d5b-3c3453a511c27c878eac-a349-4dd2-acbf-926755635e16f15e3129-fdc6-487d-bbf2-0f07a0a7446b",
    "id": "-1783730365808043612",
    "about": null,
    "infoFollowers": 0,
    "infoFollowing": 0,
    "infoHosted": 0,
    "followers": null,
    "updates": [],
    "offers": []
}
```

All API calls are structured in this way.

You can use this token for experimentation:

### Creating a new user
