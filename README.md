# Village - Public API

## Introduction

Village provides a public API.  You can use this to embed real-time, relevant information into your website.
For example, if you host an acting workshop, it may be useful to your visitors to contain a real-time list of nearby actors embedded in your site.

You need an account to use the API, and then can use the auth token generated to make additional requests.

All dates are described as strings and in the following format: `"June 30, 2009 7:03:47 AM PDT"`

## Endpoint and Authentication

The most basic call is getting information about yourself:

`http://queatz-snappy.appspot.com/api/me?auth=token`

```json
{
    "firstName": "Tara",
    "lastName": "Planas",
    "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g1XcJERenNY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/Qz35FKz9CSk/photo.jpg?sz=50",
    "auth": "286ba50c-f0bd-43d0-8d5b-3c3453a511c27c878eac-a349-4dd2-acbf-926755635e16f15e3129-fdc6-487d-bbf2-0f07a0a7446b",
    "id": "-1783730365808043612",
    "about": null,
    "infoFollowers": 0,
    "infoFollowing": 0,
    "infoHosted": 0,
    "followers": null,
    "updates": [],
    "offers": []
}
```

All API calls are structured in this way.

You can use this token for experimentation:

`ya29.GAK0vfmiAKwDf8zPm0-oRINjOSlRpwREfdiY2VWWCUx1Y8w_1DS8-LaNL7j19dPzgCGWNes`
